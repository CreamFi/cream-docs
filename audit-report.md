# Audit Report

### Trail of Bits \(January 28, 2021\)

Throughout this assessment, we \[Trail of Bits\] sought to answer various questions about the security of CREAM. We focused on flaws that would allow an attacker to:

* Manipulate asset prices returned by the price oracles.
* Subvert the imposed caps on borrowing or supplying.
* Bypass access controls to modify contract state.
