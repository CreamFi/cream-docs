# iceCREAM Tokenomics

### Summary

iceCREAM turns CREAM into a productive asset. It will have the same three main use cases as CRV - voting, staking, and boosting.

### How iceCREAM works:

* Lock CREAM between 1 week to 4 years to receive iceCREAM.
* iceCREAM is non-transferable and non-tradeable.
* 50%+ of Protocol Reserves going forward will be distributed as ycrvIB tokens to iceCREAM stakers.
* 1 iceCREAM = 1 vote in the future of C.R.E.A.M. Finance governance.
* \[phase 2\] iceCREAM staked translates to voting power which can be used to determine allocation of CREAM token liquidity mining by chain and market \(e.g.- Ethereum, ETH\).

If liquidity mining is enabled on borrow markets \(more on this as part of phase 2\)

* Once you vote, your vote will remain directed at pools unless modified.
* Users will have the ability to change their votes every week and will be able to allocate their iceCREAM to different pools.
* iceCREAM allows the user to control CREAM emissions across all C.R.E.A.M. markets in the future.
* iceCREAM increases emission from a base factor of 0.4 to a max of 2.5x, the more iceCREAM you stake, the more CREAM you earn.

### Minting iceCREAM

Assuming 1000 CREAM locked:

| minted | locked |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1000 | 4 years |
| 250 | 1 year |
| 127.4 | 6 month |
| 63.7 | 3 month |
| 21.23 | 1 month |
| 4.79 | 1 week |

iceCREAM decays linearly over time. At the unlock date of CREAM, your iceCREAM balance would be 0.

### Long-Term Staking CREAM can vote

For the early supporters of C.R.E.A.M. Finance who locked their CREAM in the long-term staking program, these token holders should be entitled to governance alongside iceCREAM holders, but will not be eligible for emission boosts.
